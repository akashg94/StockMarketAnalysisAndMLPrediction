# StockMarketAnalysisAndMachineLearningPrediction-
Abstract:

This project focused on how to make a profit in the stock market. A 12-week investment simulation will be conducted analyzing day trading and bonds in different markets. We want to be able to figure out the factors that attribute to the profits from the stock. Through this project, the knowledge learned from this will be used to create leverage for increasing a person's investing power for the future.

Goals:

The main goal of this project is to investigate investment opportunities while weighing the risks and benefits while making educated investment decisions. A detailed understanding of the risks and the opportunities on high return for each industry. By gaining all this information, this will be used to help make future decisions in making smart investments.

We want to be able to analyze specific stock markets such as Technology, Airlines, and Healthcare based on the effects of the coronavirus outbreak globally. By retrieving three different kinds of stocks in each market, we will be able to determine how well each stock will end up doing. By analyzing the stock market data with Python (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.). We will also store the data via MySql which will also help us access the data through jupyter notebook and Pycharm Python IDE, which will also help to generate graphs analyze the behavior of the data.

We will also try to implement a sort of machine learning for time series into our program. We will try to use the Random forest Algorithm as well as Prophetic time series forecasting to identify and predict the market. Further research is needed in order to complete this step. We also want to be able to implement effective team strategies in order to fully understand processes similar to Scrum.
